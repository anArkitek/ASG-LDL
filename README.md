# Towards Unbiased Label Distribution Learning for Facial Pose Estimation Using Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian 	

## Test on AFLW2000
We uploaded a pre-trained network and aflw2000 dataset along with the project thanks to their relatively small size. Simple doing the following the 

```
cd data
unzip aflw2000
cd ..
sh run_test.sh
```

## Data Preparation
We follow the same procedure as [FSA-NET](https://github.com/shamangary/FSA-Net). Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/shamangary/FSA-Net#1-data-pre-processing) for the details of data preparation.

All other datasets should be organized in the same structure just as AFLW2000 if you want to test on them.
